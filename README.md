Introduction
Traditional means of understanding data have revolved around data visualization, however there is a new force which is pushing for interpreting digital data beyond two-dimensional light emitting screens into the realm of physical three-dimensional artefacts (Moere, 2008). There are many forms of abstract data through which traditional computational display techniques (screen-based techniques) cannot capture all the essence of the data, suggesting that there is a need to move into other forms of data analysis, e.g. three-dimensional forms. Additionally, there has been an increasing desire in communities to democratize the process of interpreting data, which significantly deters from the traditional visualization techniques which were rooted in being regarded as “neutral” and “objective” in order to aid the scientific community (Moere & Patel, 2010). This push is in part due to the more pervasive awareness that data may have inherent flaws and biases, as evidenced by recent artificial intelligence chatbots such as Microsoft’s (Vincent, 2016). Therefore, it is logical to assume that feminist theory will play a significant role in the development in this new wave of data understanding and physicality, as the objectivity of systems can no longer assumed to be true or even possible (Harding, 1992).
The beginnings of design physicality can be seen in research conducted in Human Computer Interaction, often a sister profession to the Design community, such as with the nascent and developing maker community (Jenkins & Bogost, 2015). The creations that are born through the mixtures of design, technology, and science create artefacts which “produce, constitute, or perform knowledge via their dissemination and use”, implying that data physicality can bring a more robust understanding of data via designed artefacts (Jenkins et al., 2016). In short, these implications suggest there is plenty of fertile ground for the research of understanding data physicality through artefacts, both as commercial products and as critical design creations (S. Bardzell, Bardzell, Forlizzi, Zimmerman, & Antanitis, 2012). More particularly, the implementation of data physicality from a design point of view is viable, as the predominant documentation of this subject is largely conducted from the realm of Human Computer Interaction, technology, and other scientific standpoints (J. Bardzell & Bardzell, 2013). In bringing design physicality into design, there could potentially be untold ways in which designers will be able to both interact and react with the world of objects and products around them, beyond traditional objective or non- objective means.


Specific Aims
The goal of this project is to learn about the various ways data can be expressed physically, Second, we then pose the question: can data physicality be used in the design process? To uncover the underlying factors, project aims have been crafted:
1. Identify the various forms data physicality has taken in past projects
a. Identify how data physicality influences design projects and vice-versa
b. Identify the aspects that distinguish data physicality from traditional data visualization
2. Synthesize research and propose a design space for opportunity and growth in utilizing data physicality to advance a values based understanding of the impact of design
a. Develop a set of metrics or criteria based on findings in order to build out project b. Identify and select a target user group
3. Identify the following characteristics of the end artefact:
a. What data set will be collected (or simply used) for the ‘physicalization’
b. Whether the artefact will steer towards commercial use or speculative design c. Means to assess what forms the artefact could take
i. What forms correlate to what components of data
ii. How various forms correlate to various components of data
iii. Are there new forms to correlate to the data
4. Utilize interviews and surveys in other to gather input from end users and other stakeholders
a. Conduct interviews with researchers in data physicality, data journalism, digital media,
and related fields
b. Conduct interviews with target users
c. Deploy a survey to obtain further quantitative data regarding data physicality
5. Analysis of obtained input in order to direct design choices in alignment with design criteria
6. Create a functional prototype
a. Select a site for testing the prototype
7. Deploy and test a functional prototype
a. Utilize audio and visual recording to record interactions b. Leverage exit surveys to gather feedback
8. Re-evaluate the design needs, success and weaknesses
9. Deliver recommendations for future utilizations and implementations of data physicality in the design process


Methodology
The methods to solve the diverse set of problems in this research study are tailored to developing a set of utilizations and implementations of data physicality in design. Ideally, the solution developed would be deployable universally for any person or team working on a design project which necessitates the use of data physicality. However, due to constraints in terms of time and money, as well as to narrow the scope in order to effectively gather meaningful and usable data, the methods outlined will focus on evaluated recommendations regarding the use of data physicality in the design process.
1. Define the aspects of data physicality and its relationship with speculative design in order to focus the design space. Draw on literature pertaining to data, data journalism, data physicality, speculative design, critical design theory, and feminist theory to understand the various aspects.
2. Perform a literature review, and if applicable a prior art review, to learn about the current state of data physicality with regards to speculative design. Utilize this knowledge to define the design opportunity for data physicality uses in the design process.
3. Develop a set a quantifiable metrics by which the effect of incorporating various means of data physicality can be measured. These metrics will be developed by using precedents set in the literature.
4. Develop a set of interview questions and structures in order to gain meaningful data and responses from researchers. Design and deploy a survey to gather information about the end user that can then be compared to a post study survey to gauge the effectiveness of the designed and built product. The interview development and survey development will be developed and iterated on using extensive evaluation and critique from other researchers and the literature.
5. Evaluation of currently available technology and materials to use in fabricating the artefact that will be built in order to incorporate data physicality. Design the building and implementation of the
artefact. Culminate in a document noting all materials to be used and use for purchase of materials.
6. Fabricate a functional prototype and complete site selection for implementation of the prototype (if necessary). Fabricating or otherwise building out a ‘site’ for testing is beyond the scope of this project, therefore an existing location will be pursued.
7. Install the prototype in the selected site. Incorporate visual and audio recording to collect data as the interactive environment is used. Users will be recruited to utilize and interact with the artefact for a set time or task. Observations will be recorded via audio-visual tools and on-site researcher taking notes. Upon completion of time, an exit survey will be given to the tester to gather quantitative feedback on the design solution. (To be reassessed after completion of the literature review)
8. A comparison of the exit survey data to initial survey data will be compared in order to assess the impact of the artefact. This data will be visualized via tables and graphs in order to highlight the discrepancies, if any, between before and after using the artefact. Additionally, data aggregated from the audio and visual recordings will be studied and have quantifiable information taken down as well as notes of behavior.
9. The data will be synthesized together in a document detailing design best practices and recommendations for future data physicality implementations in the design process. Of importance is that the results be repeatable given the above methods in order for the knowledge to scale beyond the initial scope of this project.
In essence, this project seeks to understand the impact incorporating data physicality can have in design projects and recommendations to improve those impacts. This work seeks to lay precedence for future similar studies through a well formalized research process, verified via a comprehensive testing method in order to determine areas for future success and failure.
